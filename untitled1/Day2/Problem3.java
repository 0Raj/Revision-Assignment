    Is a super class constructor called even when there is no explicit call from a
    sub class constructor? What will be the output of below program ?

    Ans:
    Yes super class constructor will be called even If we didn't call in explicitly
    the O/P will be:
    "Animal Constructor"
    "Dog Constructor"
    "Labrador Constructor"
