   /*   Part 1 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
                 Code will execute because it is possible to extend interface from another interface.

        Part 2 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
                 In the interface it is not possible to use the "implements" key word because
                 we can extend interface from another but cannot implement it.

        Part 3 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
                 In the interface Implementation it is not possible to use the "implements" key word because
                  we can extend interface from another  but cannot implement it.

        Part 4 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
                 In the abstract class ImplementationAbstract it is possible to provide implements to interface
                 it's not be instantiated needs to extended by child class to create the object of that.

        Part 5 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
                 In the above code the variable needs to be initiated because in the interface the variable
                 is by default public static final .

        Part 6 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
                 In the above code will run because in the interface the variable
                 is by default public static final .

        Part 7 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
                 From java 8 the default methods are introduce int the interfaces to give some extra flexibility and
                 functionality to the interface and will have the body.

        Part 8 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
                 In the above code we get the output as "default" because test will have Implementation.

        Part 9 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
                 In the above code we get the output as "override" because test will have Implementation
                 but gives the priority to the implemented method.
