public class Problem1 {
/*  Part 1 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
        The below code will not execute because class Algorithm1 extends  AbstractAlgorithm
        which has an abstract method steps. The abstract method of AbstractAlgorithm should have been
        implemented inside sub class. Here it is niether implemented nor overridden so it will through an error.


    Part 2 :  Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
            The below code will execute because abstract class Algorithm1 extends  abstract AbstractAlgorithm class
            which has an abstract method steps. So it will not through any error

    Part 3 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
            It will through an complie time error because abstract class has an private member variable. Also here we
            dont have any public getter method.

    Part 4 : Check Whether the below code will execute or not. Give Reason with your answer
             It will not through any error because abstract class has an private member variable and here we
             have public getter method to access it.
